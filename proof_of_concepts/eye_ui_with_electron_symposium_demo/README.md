# Symposium DEMO

This project is a clone of [eye_ui_with_electron](../eye_ui_with_electron/).
Specific parts of the code are edited for the symposium DEMO:
- Other HDMI screens (eye configuration are different: html/css)
- Serving of control panel and app are done on 0.0.0.0 (AND NOT LOCALHOST) this way we can control the eyes remotly. 

TODO.. further explaination why...
